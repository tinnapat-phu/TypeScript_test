# typescript_test

Use VSCode with installed Node.js for run execute code with -node typescriptproj.js

Confession: I take time on this typescript code about 2 hours
because I have no experience with TypeScript (but have some exp in JavaScript)\
How I take time: \
    - lookup for differrent between JS and TS\
    - lookup for some syntax
